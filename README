1. Purpose
   -------

   The purpose of this software is to enable routeing information in a
   network (ie. Sprintlink) to be collected.  This package currently
   supports BGPv4 and ISIS and will dump MRTD format files.  It also
   supports parsing of MRTD TABLE_DUMP files (as available from, eg.,
   RouteViews and RIPE/RIS).  A number of utilities for manipulating
   these dumps are also provided.

   License version 2.  A copy is contained within this distribution in

2. Overview
   --------

   All code is written in Python v2(.1.1) and was developed under
   Redhat 7.1.  The code is split modules which may be imported and
   are described in detail below.

   A module consists of 4 parts:

   ** imports, global variables, constants, etc;
   ** module exported functions available to other programs;
   ** a wrapper class to abstract communication details and lower
      layers;
   ** an entry point ('if __name__ == "__main__": <code>').

   Protocol modules contain all 4 parts; other modules may not.

   It was tested against Zebra 0.91a and a CISCO 7xxx running IOS 12.1.

3. Code structure

     -------------------------------------------------------------------

3.0. mutils.py

     This is a generic utility module.  It provides some handy
     functions for manipulating IP addresses/prefixes, and for
     printing packed strings in hexadecimal and binary.  The naming
     convention is:

     ** mask2plen/addrmask2str:
            manipulate and print address/mask prefixes (as opposed to
            prefix/length prefixes).
            
     ** str2id/id2str/pfx2str/str2pfx: 
            convert between string and long representations of IP
            addresses/prefixes.

     ** isid2id:
            given an ISIS/CLNP address, convert to the numeric
            representation of the corresponding IP address (assuming
            the standard 11.22.33.44.55.66 -> 112.233.445.566
            mapping).

     ** int2xxx: 
            given an integer, return a string representation in base
            xxx.

     ** str2xxx: 
            given a string (ie. packed binary data a la the 'struct'
            module), return a string representation in base xxx.

     ** prtxxx: 
            print the string representation, taking care of wrapping
            and prepending a prefix to each line.

     -------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1. Protocol modules

     These provide support for particular routeing protocols; current
     ISIS and BGPv4 are supported.  Each exports functions for parsing
     messages associated with that protocol, in addition to a class
     which enables communication with other entities supporting that
     protocol for data collection purposes, and an entry point.  In
     general, the classes do not implement protocol state machines
     completely, but do the minimum necessary to start receiving
     routeing information.  Similarly, error handling is (just about)
     non-existant.  No class will advertise any routeing information.

     All protocol modules essentially work in the same manner:

     new protocol()
     initialize protocol
     while 1:
        protocol.parse()

     where the protocol constructor sets up the object, protocol
     initialization involves doing whatever needs to be done to talk
     to an entity supporting that protocol, and protocol.parse() uses
     the protocol class to read the next message in appropriately, and
     then dump and/or print it accordingly.  All listeners support 4
     verbosity options:

     ** quiet (-q): 
            output nothing.

     ** default: 
            output human readable parsing of protocol messages.

     ** verbose (-v): 
            in addition to default, output significant chunks of
            messages in binary/hex.

     ** very verbose (-V): 
            in addition to above, output results/parameters of
            recvMsg(), parseMsg(), sendMsg() (mostly for debugging
            purposes).

       -----------------------------------------------------------------

3.1.0. MRTD (mrtd.py)

       This module implements some generic logging functionality.  It
       provides support for reading and writing MRTD format log files
       in 3 formats:

       ** PROTOCOL_BGP: 
              default for the BGP module; slightly extended to allow
              messages other than UPDATEs to be dumped.

       ** PROTOCOL_BGP4MP: 
              alternative BGP dump format used by Zebra. Contains
              hacks to work around problems in Zebra dumps (v0.89 and
              0.91a).

       ** PROTOCOL_ISIS: 
              non-standard homegrown format for dumping ISIS messages.

       It provides a class to wrap up dealing with reading and writing
       MRTD dumps.  This handles details such as dump file rotation
       based on size limits.  It also attempts to be mildly efficient
       by buffering reads, whilst ensuring that there is always a
       complete MRTD message available to be parsed.  Writes are
       unbuffered at the present time.

       It also supports (with the aid of the BGP module) parsing of
       MRTD TABLE_DUMP files.

       -----------------------------------------------------------------

3.1.1. BGP v4 (bgp.py)

       This module implements the BGP listener.  It provides extensive
       parsing support, but implements a highly restricted subset of
       the state machine.  Essentially:

       initialize
       socket connect to remote end
       send OPEN
       receive OPEN
       send KEEPALIVE ## remote end should be ESTABLISHED at this point
       while 1:
           parse message

       Although all messages are parsed, NOTIFYs are not obeyed, and
       in normal operation we expect to receive only UPDATEs, and
       transmit nothing, after the connection becomes ESTABLISHED.  If
       an error occurs at any point, the script will either exit
       gracelessly or sit there waiting forever, and need to be
       restarted.

       A note on Bgp.recvMsg(): this tries to be (slightly) cunning.
       Since BGP PDUs are transported over TCP (a byte-stream with no
       PDU boundary information), we have to ensure that we read
       enough data off the socket to get a complete BGP PDU.  This is
       done by repeatedly reading into a per-instance buffer until we
       are sure that there is enough data in the buffer that the
       complete PDU can be recovered.  This has managed to be the most
       bug-ridden part of this module so far, so watch out...

       Eg.

       : $; ./bgp.py -p 10.64.233.1 -a 200 --local 10.64.233.42 -m \
                     -f bgp-dump -z $((1024*1024*5))

       -----------------------------------------------------------------

3.1.2. ISIS (isis.py)

       The module implements the ISIS listener.  It provides parsing
       support for most ISIS messages, and implements as little of the
       state machine as I could (damn those ISO protocol writers for
       being too good :-)).  None of the clever stuff about rate
       limiting transmissions, jittering timers, and so on is
       performed (we should never be transmitting so many packets that
       anyone would care).  Essentially it forms a single adjacency
       with the router to which the machine is physically connected.
       This adjacency is maintained as mandated using HELLOs
       (currently only LAN HELLOs are supported).  It then listens for
       and dumps all packets received and transmitted.  Basically:

       while 1:
           select on (message-to-read, timeout-expired)

           if message-to-read:
               Isis.parseMsg()

           else: ## we need to transmit one or more packets 
               for-each adjacency:
                   if required:
                       transmit ISIS HELLO
                   update timeout

       Since ISIS is transported directly in zero padded 802.2 frames,
       message boundaries are frame boundaries so we don't need any
       buffering cunningness a la BGP.  However, since we have 802.2
       frames, messages are retrieved via a raw socket (PF_PACKET,
       SOCK_RAW), the reason this listener requires Python v2(.1.1).
       See the comment at the start of the module for an explanation
       of the MAC/LLC encapsulation used.

       Eg.

       : $; ./isis.py -d -a 49.00.01 -z $((1024*1024*5)) -f isis-dump

     -------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2. Utilities

     In addition to the example parse.py, a small number of utilities
     are also provided in the scripts subdirectory.  In no particular
     order:

       -----------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.0. parse.py

       Dummy script that demonstrates basic use of the MRTD/protocol
       libraries and dictionary return formats.

       -----------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.1. splice.py

       This takes a number of MRTD files on the command line, and
       splices their messages together in time order (breaking ties by
       the order they appeared on the command line).  It can output to
       files of a given size, using the same rotation algorithm as the
       MRTD module.

       -----------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.2. clean.py

       This cleans a trace file, ensuring that a valid rv is returned
       for each message (at least, an rv with non-None "T" field).

5. To do
   
   ** need to _completely_ separate the parsing from pretty printing
   ** ext timestamp support is ugly -- should push into common header
   ** bgp: support KEEPALIVEs for robustness

   ** write buffering
   ** bgp: support multiple peering sessions
   ** isis: fix the finding of the IP address (ie. make -i obsolete)
